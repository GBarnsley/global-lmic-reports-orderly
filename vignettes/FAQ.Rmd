This is a living FAQ with everything to be aware of while running the fits. 


### 1. countrycode warnings

A number of countries are not in the `countrycode` database but we don't currently model these so this warning is fine:

```
Some values were not matched unambiguously: Channel Islands, Micronesia, Saint Martin, St. Barth
```

### 2. atol and rtol

`rtol` and `atol` are the per-step relative and absolute tolerance of the ODE solver used. By default these are set to `1e-6` for all ruins (the default for `dde::dopri`, which is being called to run the nimue models). However, recently for some countries the solver fails to solve model runs for countries with long period without any deaths in, i.e. sustaining an epidemic with very low levels of infection. So far, this has happened for two countries (NZL and BRN), and for these countries there is a loop inside the `script.R` for the `lmic_reports_vaccine` task to set the tolerance for these countries to `1e-8` that seemd to fix this error. If any countries produce errors discussing "vanishing step sizes" or other solver issue, check whether the country has not reported any deaths for a long time (similar to NZL in August 2021) and if so then add these countries iso3cs to this internal loop. 

### 3. Elongated summers

Currently, the fitting process does not handle periods with no deaths very well as we cannot simulate new importations with the current model framework. For a few countries, there are periods over the summer of 2020 where there were no deaths but infections were still occurring in a pattern that suggested ongoing transmission. In these countries, due to the period of no deaths, when transmission increased at the end of 2020 it was impossible for the epidemic to rebound quick enough in response to increasing transmission. As a result, we artificially introduced a few deaths during the summer to ensure the correct level of infection in the community for the fitting and then post-hoc remove these artifically introduced deaths. These countries are specified with `elong_summer_isos <- c("EST", "ISL", "ATG")` and `elong_deaths_cont_trans <- c("VNM", "TZA", "FJI")` - the difference here being that the time in the calendar year when we artificially introduce new deaths is different. 

As of the move to excess mortality, this has been removed, though we may need to add it again in future.

### 4. Complete reintroduction handling 

As above, we cannot handle importation of new cases to seed new waves after period of no transmission. In some countries, there were initial waves that appear to have been fully waned with no community transmission. When new waves are triggered in these countries, we needed a way to have new transmission occurring. To do this, we remove all deaths associated with the first epidemic wave and start the epidemic at the beginning of the second wave. To account for the level of immunity that the first wave will have produced, we apply an IFR to the number of deaths that have occurred in the first wave and use this to start the second wave with thee right amount of people in the recovered and dead compartments. These countries are specified with `reintroduction_iso3cs <- c("MMR", "BLZ", "TTO", "BHS", "HKG", "ABW", "GUM", "ISL", "BRB", "MUS")`, and the correct initial state for these countries is set up using the `init <- init_state_nimue(deaths_removed, iso3c)`.

As of the move to excess mortality, this has been removed, though we may need to add it again in future.

### 5. Countries file

The full list of countries that we model is specified in the `countries` file. This is not the full set of countries and territories that have COVID-19 deaths, however, but is the list that aligns with the countries that we model in `squire`. If any new requests for countries to be added appear (this has happened before) then you will need to `squire` and add the relevant country data for the country (population, hospital and ICU bed numbers) and then add them to the countries file to create your list of iso3cs to be run. 

### 6. Splines vs Mobility

At the beginning of the pandemic we relied on different sources of data to understand how transmission was changing in the community. To begin with we used the timing of different interventions as specified in the Oxford GRT database, before in Version 2 relying on Google mobility data to infer changes in Rt, whereby we estimated the effect of mobility (`$M_{eff}$`) on Rt for each country. As countries came out of lockdowns it was clear that increases in mobility did not affect Rt in the same way as when mobility was falling and so we estimated a new parameter for the effect of mobility post lockdown (`$M_{eff,pl}$`). This worked for a time however it was clear that each countries `$R_0$` had also changed (better contact tracing, testing, human awareness etc.) and so we introduced a one time shift in Rt (the Rt_shift parameters) to accommodate this. However, this quickly was failing to be predictive at which point we removed this by setting the bounds for this shift ~0 (no shift to be inferred) and swapped to inferring changes in Rt every fortnight (`Rt_rw_x`). These inferred changes to Rt were assumed to be on top of any changes that could be explained by mobility, i.e. if mobility and Rt were still related then this would ideally explain the changes in tranmsission as opposed to the fortnightly changes in Rt. The reason for wanting this feature of the model fitting was such that in countries in which mobility was still informative we were then able to forecast what might happen if mobility returned to previous levels, whereas if mobility was not informative we have no information to explain future trajectories. A full overview of these method changes over time is in the methods described in the [News](https://mrc-ide.github.io/global-lmic-reports/News.html) and [Parameters](https://mrc-ide.github.io/global-lmic-reports/parameters.html).

The reason for explaining the above in depth is to set up the explanation of why for some countries we no longer use mobility at all. These countries are specified here:

`spline_iso3cs <- c("CHN","MAC","TWN","KOR", "RWA", "PNG", "DZA", "COD", "SYR", "TUN", "UGA","UZB", "BEL","IRN")`

For these countries, we set mobility over time to be always 1 (i.e no mobility pattern), which then relies solely on the fortnightly changes in Rt. For the countries specified, we either 1) do not believe the mobility data to be informative/representative of the country as a whole (e.g. CHN), 2) do not believe the mobility data that we have inferred for the country using the boosted regression tree model (usually due to no new reports of interventions in the ACAPs database that was used to parameterise this) (e.g IRN), or 3) because the mobility data and the epidemic are uncoupled/delayed and as such the mobility data is not going to explain the dynamics of the epidemic sufficiently well (e.g. BEL). For these countries, we rely solely on the fortnightly shifts, which in general are much more reliable for fitting but do require a longer initial mcmc chain to estimate these.

As of the new fitting method we soley use untransformed splines in the fitting process. Simply, this works with the new method better though may need adapting if we want to perform inference with these model fits.

### 7. Github file size issues 

When you push the Github pages from `gh-pages` the website repository, you will notice warnings about the file size of the data zip that is being pushed. The limit for this is 100Mb, which will be reached shortly with the size of the model projections. This zip file is generated in the `run/copy_reports_vaccine.R` script. One option to address this issue would be to combine half of the countries into one zip, e.g. `2021-09-01_a_v8.csv.zip` and `2021-09-01_b_v8.csv.zip`. If this option is taken, then it would be good to update the `gh-pages/data/schema.md` document to explain what has happened. 

### 8. Data schema

The `gh-pages/data/schema.md` file explains what information is exported in the data directory and what is included in the `projections.csv` files that are exported in the root of each country directory (e.g. https://github.com/mrc-ide/global-lmic-reports/blob/master/ATG/projections.csv). This `schema.md` document is written using the `R/gh_pages.R` function that is called within `vignettes/dide_run.Rmd`

### 9. Old model run data 

Github repositories can only store 10Gb of files. We often have hit this number, mostly due to the old model run data. As of last week, most of the old model run data has been moved to [https://mrcdata.dide.ic.ac.uk/global-lmic-reports/](https://mrcdata.dide.ic.ac.uk/global-lmic-reports/). This only needs to be done periodically when the Github website limit gets reached (Rich will likely email me/you about this when it happens). When this happens, simply zip up all the old data objects in the data directory into one object, copy it to the TMP directory (T:/) and message Wes, who will move it onto the mrc data directory above. It is probably not worth saving the age stratified data.

### 10. Late date_R0_change after data errors

When you specify a date for the model fits to be done, ALWAYS pick a date that is 2 days earlier than the current date, e.g. if it is the 27th today then run a model fit for no later than the 25th. The reason for this is that the death data is only available across all data sources (JHU and worldometers) 2 days after the date asked due to delays in data collection. (In truth, what happens is the worldometers data that is reported is actually one day shifted from the JHU data, i.e the deaths reported on the 26th for worldometers actually correspond to the 25th in the JHU data but the dates are not the same so we have to set the date back for worldometers). If you do not do this you will get an error from the model fits that the last date in `date_R0_change` is after the last date in the data.  

### 11. What do if there is an error/issue that is not explained by this FAQ?

This will happen. This will happen as a) I have not remembered everything that has thrown a bug/error over the last 18 months and b) new errors and slight modelling peculiarities will pop up, e.g. the `atol` and `rtol` issue only occurred last week. A sensible approach for looking at new errors may look something like:

1. Check that it is not actually described in this FAQ or the glodide FAQ
2. See if the error is reliably hit after just rerunning the model fit
3. If repeatable then step through the error locally using `orderly::orderly_develop_start`

Once you have had to get to 3. above you should be able to isolate exactly where the error has happened. If it happens during the `pmcmc` function call within the `furrr` or `purrr` call, then remember that `Sys.setenv("SQUIRE_PARALLEL_DEBUG" = "TRUE")` will ensure that the `purrr` call is used, which will allow for easier debugging of this process.
