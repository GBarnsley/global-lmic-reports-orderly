## Model Structure

The LMIC reports are generated using an age-structured SEIR model. The developed model is an extension of the model used in our previous report (see [Report 12](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-12-global-impact-covid-19/) and the related [publication](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/06/11/science.abc0035)) and the source code for the model can be found at [https://github.com/mrc-ide/squire](https://github.com/mrc-ide/squire). In this model, the infectious class is divided into different stages reflecting progression through different disease severity pathways. These compartments are:

* S = Susceptibles 
* E = Exposed (Latent Infection) 
* $I_{Mild}$ = Mild Infections (Not Requiring Hospitalisation) â€“ including asymptomatic infection 
* $I_{Case}$ = Infections that will subsequently require hospitalisation 
* $I_{Hospital}$ = Hospitalised Infection (Requires General Hospital Bed) 
* $I_{ICU}$ = Hospitalised Infection in critical care/ICU (Requires critical care/ICU Bed) 
* $I_{Rec}$ = Hospitalised Infection Recovering from critical care/ICU Stay (Requires General Hospital Bed) 
* R = Recovered 
* D = Dead

<center>
![](structure.JPG){width=75%}
</center>
<br>

Given initial inputs of hospital/ICU bed capacity and the average time cases spend in hospital, the model dynamically tracks available hospital and ICU beds over time. Individuals newly requiring hospitalisation (either a hospital or ICU bed) are then assigned to either receive care (if the relevant bed is available) or not (if maximum capacity would be exceeded otherwise). Whether or not an individual receives the required care modifies their probability of dying.

In more recent model fitting and scenario projections, we model the roll out of vaccinations. For this work we use the extended version of the above model that was used in our previous reports on vaccination (see [Report 33](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-33-vaccine/) and the related [publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21004278)) and the source code for the model can be found at [https://github.com/mrc-ide/nimue](https://github.com/mrc-ide/nimue).

This particular model is an extension to [nimue](https://github.com/mrc-ide/nimue) that incorporates booster doses (source code [here](https://github.com/mrc-ide/squire.page/blob/main/inst/odin/nimue_booster.R), which is liable to change). For more information see this [vignette](https://mrc-ide.github.io/squire.page/articles/booster_pathway.html).

## Fitting Procedure

To calibrate our model to the deaths (or excess-mortality) we first simulate
random draws from pre-define distributions on our models parameters (defined below).
Then we optimise the $R_t$ values over defined period to get a close fit
to the death curve. Please see this [vignette](https://mrc-ide.github.io/squire.page/articles/rt_optimise.html) for a more technical overview. These parameter draws and $R_t$ trajectories are then used to
simulate our scenarios and infection curves.

### Interventions

We represent any interventions as changes to the overall $R_t$ of the epidemic,
which we define as the reproductive number in the *absence* of vaccine or disease
derived immunity. We allow this value to vary every 2 weeks, which represents
changes to mobility, interventions, and changes in transmission due to variants.

### Variant Adjustments

We make adjustments for the non-transmission effects of variants. These are 
mainly immune-escape from vaccine and infection derived protection. For reduced vaccine efficacies
we scale these values over a period where the new variant is deemed to have become dominant.
For the escape from natural protection, we increase the rate of loss of immunity over this period.
The timings of these periods are determined using sequence data from [NextStrain](https://nextstrain.org/)
and are reported on each countries page, with caveats.

### Uncertainty

We allow these parameters to vary across each sample, this allow us to incorporate 
our uncertainty in these values.

#### Vaccine Efficacy

The table below shows the central VE estimates by vaccine type (taken from the appendix of [Watson et al.](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00320-6/fulltext)):

*WIP*

These parameters are then used to generate waning efficacy curves using a simulated
antibody decay which the models vaccine parameters are then fitted to. Uncertainty
is incorporated by drawing from a Beta distribution centred on those fitted
parameter values. Which vaccine type to model is uniformly selected from all
vaccines reported to have been used in the country.

#### Baseline Infection Fatality Ratio

To maintain consistency within the age-structured IFR, we simulate a single value for all ages
and scale between lower, central, and upper estimates with this value. These values are:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tribble(
    ~central, ~low, ~high,
    0.00, 0.00, 0.03,
    0.01, 0.00, 0.06,
    0.01, 0.00, 0.11,
    0.02, 0.00, 0.18,
    0.03, 0.00, 0.30,
    0.04, 0.00, 0.46,
    0.06, 0.01, 0.71,
    0.10, 0.01, 1.03,
    0.16, 0.02, 1.47,
    0.24, 0.03, 2.03,
    0.38, 0.05, 2.74,
    0.60, 0.10, 3.64,
    0.94, 0.18, 4.79,
    1.47, 0.35, 6.27,
    2.31, 0.65, 8.21,
    3.61, 1.21, 10.8,
    #caculate these based on the countries population
    weighted.mean(c(5.66, 8.86, 17.37), squire::get_elderly_population(iso3c = "GBR")$n),
    weighted.mean(c(2.23, 4.06, 9.7), squire::get_elderly_population(iso3c = "GBR")$n),
    weighted.mean(c(14.37, 19.36, 31.12), squire::get_elderly_population(iso3c = "GBR")$n)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(age = seq_along(central),
         age = if_else(age== max(age), paste0((age-1)*5, "+"), paste0((age - 1)*5, " - ", age*5))
  ) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  transmute(
    `Age-Group` = age, Central = base::format(signif(central, 3)), Lower = base::format(signif(low, 3)), Upper = base::format(signif(high, 3))
  ) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Infection Fatality Ratio (%) (assuming healthcare capacity unmet)")
  
```

Calculated from IFR in [Report 34](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-34-ifr/).
To produce this IFR we scale the probabilities of hospitalisation, severity, and death given severity, with defaults:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tibble(
  age = seq_along(nimue:::probs$prob_hosp),
  prob_hosp = nimue:::probs$prob_hosp,
  prob_severe = nimue:::probs$prob_severe,
  `Age-Group` = if_else(age == max(age), paste0((age - 1) * 5, "+"), paste0((age-1)*5, " - ", age*5))
) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  transmute(
    `Age-Group` = `Age-Group`,
    `Probability of Hospitalisation (%), given infection` = base::format(signif(prob_hosp * 100, 3)),
    `Probability of Requiring ICU (%), given hospitalisation` = base::format(signif(prob_severe * 100, 3))
  ) %>% 
  add_row(
    `Age-Group` = "Source:",
    `Probability of Hospitalisation (%), given infection` = "[Salje et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.abc3517)",
    `Probability of Requiring ICU (%), given hospitalisation` = "[Salje et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.abc3517)"
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

The probability of death without healthcare is given by:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

var <- 0.001
means <- unique(c(nimue:::probs$prob_severe_death_no_treatment,
                 nimue:::probs$prob_non_severe_death_no_treatment))
alphas <- means*(means*(1-means)/var - 1)
betas <- (alphas - means*alphas)/means
tibble(
  Severity = c("Requires ICU", "Does not Require ICU"),
  alpha = alphas,
  beta = betas
) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  transmute(
    Severity = Severity,
    Distribution = paste0("Beta(", signif(alpha, 3), ", ", signif(beta, 3), ")"),
    `95% CI` = paste0(base::format(signif(qbeta(c(0.025, 0.975), alpha, beta), 3)), collapse = ", ")
  ) %>% kable(caption = "Probability of Death without treatment")
```

This values are informed by expert opinion.

Please note that this IFR is representative of Wild-type COVID-19 in our model.

The mean duration of natural immunity is assumed to be distributed by $\mathrm{Gamma}(20, 4/73)$ with 95% CI of `r paste0(signif(qgamma(c(0.025, 0.975), 20, 4/73), 3), collapse = ", ")` days.
